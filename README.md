Java Concepts:
  1. Abstraction
  2. Polymorphism
  3. Inheritance
  4. Encapsulation
  5. Association - (IS-A) - Inheritance
  6. Aggregation - (HAS-A) - As opposed to composition, there is no ownership involed and composed object has its own life cycle and it doesn't get destroyed when        containing object is destroyed. e.g. Order and inventory
  7. Comnposition - (strong HAS-A)- Containing object owns the composed objects. Composed objects dont have its own life ccyle. If owner obect is destroyed, its          members also will be destroyed. E.g. Inner classes / order and    
    
Java Principles (SOLID) 
  1. Single responsibility principle
  2. Open-Close principle
  3. Liskov substitution principle
  4. Inversion of control principle
  5. Dependency Injection principle

  1. Creational DP - how objects are created
    1. Builder
    2. Singleton
    3. Factory
    4. Abstract factory
    
  2. Structural DP - how objects are structured
    1. Facade
    2. Adaptor
    3. Decorator
    4. 
    
  3. Behavioral DP - how obects interact with each other
    1. Iterator
    2. Template
    3. Memento
